# ExpenseTrackerApiSdk Python SDK 1.0.0

Welcome to the ExpenseTrackerApiSdk SDK documentation. This guide will help you get started with integrating and using the ExpenseTrackerApiSdk SDK in your project.

## Versions

- SDK version: `1.0.0`

## About the API

A REST API for company expense claims. Employees record expenses and group them into claims. Approvers approve or reject claims. Finance maintains categories and marks approved claims as reimbursed.

**Three entities:** Category, Expense, Claim
**Reporting currency:** EUR (all monetary values exact to 2 decimal places)
**Authentication:** JWT bearer token with role-based access (employee, approver, finance)

**Status transitions for claims:**
draft → submitted → approved/rejected → reimbursed

**Key rules:**

- Expenses must have receipts when amount exceeds category threshold
- Claims require at least one expense to submit
- Expenses can belong to only one claim
- Date incurred must not be in the future
- Expenses older than 90 days cannot be added to claims

# Setup & Configuration

## Supported Language Versions

This SDK is compatible with the following versions: `Python >= 3.9`

## Installation

To get started with the SDK, we recommend installing using `pip`:

```bash
pip install expense_tracker_api_sdk
```

If you are using Python 3, you can use `pip3` instead:

```bash
pip3 install expense_tracker_api_sdk
```

## Disabling Redirects

By default, the SDK follows HTTP redirects (3xx responses) automatically. Pass
`follow_redirects=False` to get the redirect response back as-is instead:

```python
client = ExpenseTrackerApiSdk(follow_redirects=False)
```

This can also be changed later with `client.set_follow_redirects(False)`.

## Logging

The SDK is silent by default. Pass a standard library `logging.Logger` as `logger` to log
every outgoing request and its response (method, URL, status, and duration):

```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger("ExpenseTrackerApiSdk")
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
logger.addHandler(logging.StreamHandler())

client = ExpenseTrackerApiSdk(logger=logger)
```

This can also be changed later with `client.set_logging(logger)`.

`Authorization` and `Cookie` header values are always redacted in logged output, regardless
of the logger's own configuration.

## Authentication

### Access Token Authentication

The ExpenseTrackerApiSdk API uses an Access Token for authentication.

This token must be provided to authenticate your requests to the API.

#### Setting the Access Token

When you initialize the SDK, you can set the access token as follows:

```py
ExpenseTrackerApiSdk(
    access_token="YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN",
    timeout=10
)
```

If you need to set or update the access token after initializing the SDK, you can use:

```py
sdk.set_access_token("YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN")
```

## Setting a Custom Timeout

You can set a custom timeout for the SDK's HTTP requests as follows:

```py
from expense_tracker_api_sdk import ExpenseTrackerApiSdk

sdk = ExpenseTrackerApiSdk(timeout=10)
```

# Sample Usage

Below is a comprehensive example demonstrating how to authenticate and call a simple endpoint:

```py
from expense_tracker_api_sdk import ExpenseTrackerApiSdk, Environment

sdk = ExpenseTrackerApiSdk(
    access_token="YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN",
    base_url=Environment.DEFAULT.value,
    timeout=10
)

result = sdk.expense_tracker_api_sdk.list_categories(
    page="1",
    page_size="20",
    active="true"
)

print(result)

```

# Async Usage

The SDK includes an Async Client for making asynchronous API requests. This is useful for applications that need non-blocking operations, like web servers or apps with a graphical user interface.

```py
import asyncio
from expense_tracker_api_sdk import ExpenseTrackerApiSdkAsync, Environment
from expense_tracker_api_sdk.models import CreateCategoryRequest

sdk = ExpenseTrackerApiSdkAsync(
    access_token="YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN",
    base_url=Environment.DEFAULT.value,
    timeout=10
)


request_body = CreateCategoryRequest(
    name="Travel",
    receipt_threshold=50,
    active=True
)

async def main():
  result = await sdk.expense_tracker_api_sdk.create_category(request_body=request_body)
  print(result)

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Services

The SDK provides various services to interact with the API.
