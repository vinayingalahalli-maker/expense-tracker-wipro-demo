# ExpenseTrackerApiSdk TypeScript SDK 1.0.0

Welcome to the ExpenseTrackerApiSdk SDK documentation. This guide will help you get started with integrating and using the ExpenseTrackerApiSdk SDK in your project.

## Versions

- SDK version: `1.0.0`

## About the API

A REST API for company expense claims. Employees record expenses and group them into claims. Approvers approve or reject claims. Finance maintains categories and marks approved claims as reimbursed.

**Three entities:** Category, Expense, Claim
**Reporting currency:** EUR (all monetary values exact to 2 decimal places)
**Authentication:** JWT bearer token with role-based access (employee, approver, finance)

**Status transitions for claims:**
draft → submitted → approved/rejected → reimbursed

**Key rules:**

- Expenses must have receipts when amount exceeds category threshold
- Claims require at least one expense to submit
- Expenses can belong to only one claim
- Date incurred must not be in the future
- Expenses older than 90 days cannot be added to claims

## Authentication

### Access Token Authentication

The ExpenseTrackerApiSdk API uses an Access Token for authentication.

This token must be provided to authenticate your requests to the API.

#### Setting the Access Token

When you initialize the SDK, you can set the access token as follows:

```ts
const sdk = new ExpenseTrackerApiSdk({ token: 'YOUR_TOKEN' });
```

If you need to set or update the access token after initializing the SDK, you can use:

```ts
const sdk = new ExpenseTrackerApiSdk();
sdk.token = 'YOUR_TOKEN';
```

## Setting a Custom Timeout

You can set a custom timeout for the SDK's HTTP requests as follows:

```ts
const expenseTrackerApiSdk = new ExpenseTrackerApiSdk({ timeoutMs: 10000 });
```

# Sample Usage

Below is a comprehensive example demonstrating how to authenticate and call a simple endpoint:

```ts
import { ExpenseTrackerApiSdk } from 'expense-tracker-api-sdk';

(async () => {
  const expenseTrackerApiSdk = new ExpenseTrackerApiSdk({
    token: 'YOUR_TOKEN',
  });

  const data = await expenseTrackerApiSdk.expenseTrackerApiSdk.listCategories({
    page: '1',
    pageSize: '20',
    active: 'true',
  });

  console.log(data);
})();
```
